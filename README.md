# CS4850-Robot
Repository for the CS4850 robot group

Base movement script connects the UXA-90 robot and Raspberry Pi to the Meta Quest 2. VR controller inputs are sent to the Raspberry Pi and API calls are made to control the robot's basic motion: moving left, right, and forward, or rotating left or right.
